# Explore Week - 11-19 November 2017

**It's CS Explore Week, free from lectures and deadlines**. We're putting on a range of events to keep you entertained and help you explore the world of Computer Science.

## **Tuesday November 14**: Bloomberg Accessibility Hackathon

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/479772452408106/">![CSS Explore Week Hackathon 2017](/assets/images/contrib/events/2017-11-explore-week/accessibility-hackathon-cover-image.png)</a>

**10am-4.30pm, MVB Atrium**

You asked for a shorter hackathon: we delivered!

In six hours, it's up to you to build something that makes the world a more accessible place.

What will you build? Here are some ideas to get you started.

* Screen readers for augmented reality
* An alternative to mouse and keyboard
* Eye-tracking interfaces
* Hearing aids that only relay the most important information
* A design for privacy settings that children can understand
* Drones that pick stuff up for you

There will be food, drinks and prizes (of course!)

Join us, eat some food and find the fun side of programming #FreeFood
