# Welcome!

Hello! We are the University of Bristol Computer Science Society.

Congratulations on getting into a great university and department (which just happens to be full of great people!)

You'll be pretty busy over the next few weeks, so we've collected together some information which you might find useful.

## Freshers' Week 2017

We've got a number of exciting events lined up for Freshers' Week (also known as Welcome Week). As details become available they will be posted here, on the calendar and most importantly on the [Facebook groups](#staying-in-the-loop), but here's an idea of what we're planning:

* An exciting(-ish) stand at the Welcome Fair
* A night out or two. Yes, computer scientists *can* party ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¾
* Complete the Cori tap [challenge](https://thetab.com/uk/bristol/2017/03/24/ten-step-guide-cori-tap-challenge-29087)??
* Have a crack at some coding at the CSS Hackathon!
* Attempt to use 3D printers
* more detailed events to come ...
