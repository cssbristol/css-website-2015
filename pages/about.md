# Hi there, we're CSS Bristol!

CSS is the official Computer Science Society at the University of Bristol, run by students, for students. We represent all the students within our department, organise social events and industry talks, run a mentor scheme, advertise job openings exclusive to our students, and much more!

This website is our society's hub: feel free to read our [user-submitted tutorials](/tutorials) and [student blogs](/blog), see what we're up to on our social media presences, and get updates on society news and events. Stay in the loop by joining the [CSS Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CSSBristol/) and signing up for our [newsletter](/newsletter)!

To get in touch with a committee member or a course rep, please feel free to [send us an e-mail](/contact). To report an issue with the website, you may do so via [GitHub](https://github.com/cssbristol/cssbristol.github.io/issues) or by e-mailing the current Webmaster.

The committee holds frequent meetings to organise events and to decide the future of the society.
Take a look at the [minutes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11IjgcZ8T9o9GghWwNd2Wn29jSz8un7sY?usp=sharing) to see what we're up to!
