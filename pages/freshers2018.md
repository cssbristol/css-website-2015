# Welcome!

Hello! We are the University of Bristol Computer Science Society.

Congratulations on getting into a great university and department (which just happens to be full of great people!)

You'll be pretty busy over the next few weeks, so we've collected together some information which you might find useful.

## Freshers' Week 2018

We've got a number of exciting events lined up for Freshers' Week (also known as Welcome Week). You can find details about them here, as well as on the [Facebook groups](#staying-in-the-loop):

## Useful Information

There's lots of useful information available in our Freshers' Booklet. You should be receiving a hard copy soon, but [here it is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TDrIpra9e8VHeubmNHxgXFOp8tKOL0K/view) if you haven't already.

The society is run each year by an [selected committee](/contact/). Come say hi! We don't bite.

Looking for course materials? Almost everything lives [here, on the University of Bristol CS website](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/). You'll have to wait until you arrive to be able to log in.

We'll also be adding more [tutorials](/tutorials/) in the coming months. Meanwhile, if you're back here trying to work out how on earth to connect to Snowy: [here you go](/tutorials/ssh-into-snowy/).
