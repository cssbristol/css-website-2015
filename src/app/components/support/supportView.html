Rational behind this page
-------------------------

To provide as much information on the support avilable to students as possible
in the most clear and concise way.

Key Considerations:
- Provide information on the situations each service is equipped to deal with.
- Contact information: email, web, phone, address.
- Many students do not speak english as their first language. Keep the
  sentence construction and vocabulary clear and easy to parse.
- Aim for inclusivity of information, rather than only the most common problems
- Some of this content might make people feel uncomfortable to see. This might
  be because they find the topic awkward, have been personally affected by it,
  or are sceptical about the severity / worth / importance of the problem.
  Any and all steps should be taken to make people feel comfortable with
  the content, and explain why it is nessecary.
- While the page aims to have as much information is possible, make sure it is
  all framed in a way such that it's relevance is immediately clear to
  computer science students.

    <div class="section-title">Who is this page for?</div>
    <div class="section-content clear">
        This page is for all Computer Science students (whether at
        undergraduate, masters or post graduate level) at the University
        of Bristol. It also serves for students on joint honours courses like
        Computer Science and Electronics, or Computer Science and Maths. It
        aims to hold all of the information we need on where to seek support
        during our studdies. In the past, it has been difficult to know exactly
        where to go if we have a problem that is effecting our studdies that is
        not strictly academic in nature. This page aims to solve that, and put
        all of the resources in one place.

        In short, anything that is having a negative impact on your ability
        to study, or otherwise do the things you want to do. This might
        include, but is definitely not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Family problems like a bereavement, or separation of parents.</li>
            <li>Problems with flatmates or friends, whether in real life or
                online in discussion forums like Facebook, Twitter, Yik-Yak
                and Snapchat. It also covers problems working with other
                people in group projects.</li>
            <li>Struggling to cope with deadlines. This might be balancing your
                effort between multiple assignments, or simply finding the
                stress of it all is stopping you being as capable as you feel
                you should be. We all get stressed, it is part of the course.
                A certain amount of stress can be motivational, even healthy.
                The moment it begins to effect your day to day happiness or
                will and ability to function as a person, then it is a good
                idea to seek help.</li>
            <li>If you had a pre-existing problem when you arrived at 
                university and want to know what support is available. This
                might be a physical or mental illness, special requirements
                for exams, or anything you have needed help for in the past. It
                need not be something <i>official</i>, university can be a
                good opportunity to seek help for a problem you've not looked 
                to solve before.</li>
            <li>Any sort of trouble with sexism, homophobia, racism, 
                transphobia, ableism or discrimination of any kind. Whether you
                experience this yourself, or as something you have witnessed as
                a 3rd party.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        It is worth giving special mention to two subjects in particular. We do
        not hold them to be more or less important than others mentioned, but
        time has shown that they have been encountered a disproportionate
        amount both at Bristol, and in the wider Computer Science community.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Stress &amp; Mental Health</b><br/>
        Studying Computer Science is stressful. Multiple deadlines, exams and
        group projects all add up and take their toll. Many people are able to
        cope with this stress, but for some people it starts to effect their
        health outside of University and their ability to function properly.
        For some, it can lead to bouts of depression, and other mental illness.
        This has been a very taboo topic in the past, with a lot of
        misunderstanding and grief as a result. It is important that we create
        an environment within the computer science community at Bristol where
        people feel able to ask for help without worrying about stigma and how
        their peers will judge them. Similarly, if someone does open up to you,
        it is important that you are comfortable in knowing how to respond!
        There is a lot of advice on line on talking about mental health, and
        how to seek help. This page won't seek to replicate that, but the
        services listed below have lots of information on it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Nastiness In Online Discussion Spaces</b><br/>
        We all know the internet has both wonderful corners and darker ones.
        Above all, we know the importance of respecting each other online, and
        not forgetting that there is a real human on the other end of a comment
        thread. Occasionally this does get forgotten, and nastiness ensues. If
        you ever feel uncomfortable in an online space or in person, then the
        department, students union and university have guidelines on how to
        deal with it. As a union affiliated society, CSS is bound by their safe
        space policy. Such policies are often drastically misunderstood and end
        up being ridiculed online.  BristolSU's 
        <a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/pageassets/activities/societies/roomandequipmentbookings/Safe-Space-Policy-motion.pdf">safe space policy can be read here</a>
        so you know exactly what
        it does and does not say. There are also some 
        <a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/pageassets/democracy/events/policy/SafeSpaceBestPracticeGuide-Edited.pdf">guidelines</a> available for
        how to interpret the safe space policy in a sensible way.
        Any problems you have yourself, or witness as
        a 3rd party, can be raised with your personal tutor or the students
        union.
        </p>

        <p>
        Again, none of this is supposed to be a definitive list. At the end of
        the day, if you feel that your ability to study is being negatively
        effected by something, then the best thing you can do is seek help as
        soon as possible, and not bottle it up and hope it passes!

                For most things, your personal tutor should be your first point

                when it comes to seeking further help, and are best placed to
                help with problems that are academic in nature like friction 
                with team mates or other coursework. It is their job to
                fight your corner in all matters between yourself and the

                </p>
                <p>
                You should have been told who your personal tutor is, and

        <!-- I anticipate this addition causing a certain amount of curiosity,
             and questioning of its nessecity. Bottom line, if people don't
             see the need, then they fall into one of two categories:
             They can safely ignore this because to them it is "obvious", or
             they are the people to whom the information would be the most
             useful. -->

                The University offers a lot of support and information around
                sex, consent, and clearing up myths and misunderstandings. If
                you don't know what the fuss is about, want to understand more
                about consent, or need support for yourself or a friend, then
                the University can help. It is nothing to be embarrassed about.

                <p>
                The Vulnerable Students' Support Service coordinates support
                for our most vulnerable students who are, for whatever reason,
                having difficulties functioning or continuing their studies
                for non-academic reasons. They work closely with staff in
                academic schools and students are supported by the most
                appropriate service(s) from within Student Services
                and/or from the NHS. Wherever possible they prefer to
                provide pre-emptive support but are experienced in
                managing crises.
                </p>
                <p>
                Examples of support include cases of students with undiagnosed
                or unsupported mental ill health including first incidents of
                psychosis, the consequences of addiction, those who are
                seemingly missing, victims of domestic violence, managing
                family estrangements, and many more.
