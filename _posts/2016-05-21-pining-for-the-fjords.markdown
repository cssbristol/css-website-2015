*A customer enters a pet shop.*

**Mr. Praline**: 'Ello, I wish to register a complaint.

*(The owner does not respond.)*

**Mr. Praline**: 'Ello, Miss?

**Owner**: What do you mean "miss"?

**Mr. Praline**: *(pause)* I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint!

**Owner**: We're closin' for lunch.

**Mr. Praline**: Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.

**Owner**: Oh yes, the, uh, the Norwegian Blue...What's,uh...What's wrong with it?

**Mr. Praline**: I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. 'E's dead, that's what's wrong with it!

**Owner**: No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting.

**Mr. Praline**: Look, matey, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.

**Owner**: No no he's not dead, he's, he's restin'! Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!

**Mr. Praline**: The plumage don't enter into it. It's stone dead.

**Owner**: Nononono, no, no! 'E's resting!

**Mr. Praline**: All right then, if he's restin', I'll wake him up! (shouting at the cage) 'Ello, Mister Polly Parrot! I've got a lovely fresh cuttle fish for you if you show...

*(owner hits the cage)*

**Owner**: There, he moved!

**Mr. Praline**: No, he didn't, that was you hitting the cage!

**Owner**: I never!!

**Mr. Praline**: Yes, you did!

**Owner**: I never, never did anything...

**Mr. Praline**: *(yelling and hitting the cage repeatedly)* 'ELLO POLLY!!!!! Testing! Testing! Testing! Testing! This is your nine o'clock alarm call!

*(Takes parrot out of the cage and thumps its head on the counter. Throws it up in the air and watches it plummet to the floor.)*

**Mr. Praline**: Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

**Owner**: No, no.....No, 'e's stunned!

**Mr. Praline**: STUNNED?!?

**Owner**: Yeah! You stunned him, just as he was wakin' up! Norwegian Blues stun easily, major.

**Mr. Praline**: Um...now look...now look, mate, I've definitely 'ad enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I purchased it not 'alf an hour ago, you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it bein' tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk.

**Owner**: Well, he's...he's, ah...probably pining for the fjords.

**Mr. Praline**: PININ' for the FJORDS?!?!?!? What kind of talk is that?, look, why did he fall flat on his back the moment I got 'im home?

**Owner**: The Norwegian Blue prefers keepin' on it's back! Remarkable bird, id'nit, squire? Lovely plumage!

**Mr. Praline**: Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot when I got it home, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been NAILED there.
