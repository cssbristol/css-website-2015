The university has a couple of pages for finding study spaces. [Here's the main one](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/study-spaces/).

## New: find a free desk

Library staff count the number of people in each library hourly. In the exam periods this year, the university is trialling ['Find a study desk'](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/computer/table), which is based on this data.

Hot tip: there's a JSON API! Here's the [building information](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/api/v1/building?extended), and here are the [study space stats](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/api/v1/study-space-stats).

There's also a page for [finding a free computer](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/computer/table).

## Where else can I work?

Some places that aren't officially documented. Found an obscure place to work? [Open an issue and we'll add it to this page](https://github.com/cssbristol/cssbristol.github.io/issues)

### Study areas

If you've done or are doing Software Product Engineering, you should have access to the Student Project Lab ('backlab'), MVB 2.09 (just beyond 2.11). If you need a second monitor, this is the place to go. Third years and above should also have access to the Device Lab, MVB 2.10 (with the curved glass wall).

There is also a 'quiet pod' for one or two people on level 2 of the MVB atrium.

In Queen's, there are a few non-library areas with seating:

* off the left of the main atrium, at the front of the building. This area also has bookable group study rooms.
* the atrium of the new wing, at the back of the building
* the east wing of the building on the first floor

### Workshop spaces

#### MVB Hack Space

The Hack Space in MVB can be used by all students who have done a short induction. [Sign up for a Hack Space induction](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG9uxlQ02RedJrGn7w_PBMbFUQ0lIUVc0SUpWTDAzRDRHQUdXTkNVVlJRSS4u). The equipment available includes a laser cutter, 3D printer, soldering irons and a 3D carving machine. A component vending machine is being installed outside the Hack Space.

#### Student Workshop
The [student workshop](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/facilities/student-workshop/) has equipment including a laser cutter; 3D printers; a lathe and [one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmvKlnhMjUw). You'll need to be trained on some of the equipment first but if you're planning to take part in BEEES [Robot Wars](http://www.beees.co.uk/events/robotwars/) you're probably going to spend a lot of time in here.

#### BIG Lab

The [Bristol Interaction and Graphics](http://www.biglab.co.uk/) group has a lab on level 2 of the MVB Atrium. If you're taking Interactive Devices, you can use this lab to work on your device.

### Humanities - Woodland Road

There are a few common rooms accessible to everyone between 3 and 19 Woodland Road. These houses are joined by a corridor at the back, so you can enter at one end and walk along the whole thing.
