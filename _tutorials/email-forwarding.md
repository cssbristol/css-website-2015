Too many inboxes? Did becomming a HPT screw you over now that you have to check both your `@bristol.ac.uk` and `@my.bristol.ac.uk` email? Well if that's the case this tutorial is for you!

## Email forwarding

Emails are really old[¹](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_email). The good part is that is you'd like to do something, someone else has probably thought about it and done it before you. 

There's two main ways to perform email forwarding: forwarding or fetching[²](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Email_forwarding). Both ideas has its benifits and drawbacks which I'll hopefully give a brief overview of here. For my examples I'm going to assume that you use a Gmail inbox (the `@my.bristol.ac.uk` email) and would like to forward emails from Outlook (the `@bristol.ac.uk` email). The steps are very similar for forwarding between Gmail to Gmail, Gmail to Outlook and vice versa.  

### Forwarding

As the name suggests, the client does the work of forwarding. If I use normal mail as an analogy, here's what it'll sound like:

You recieve a letter at your house. You open it to inspect what's inside. After having the opportuity to look at what's inside you decide that you'd like to repackage the latter and send it to another address. At the other address the other person receives a letter.

The main benifit with client based forwarding is that at your first address you can act as a filter and decide which types of mail you'd like to forward. The address that you're forwarding to doesn't have to know that any of this exists, as far as he's concerned he's just got a mail like any other. 

### Fetching

You give the key to your mailbox to someone else. Periodically they are able to come to your mailbox, see what letters were addressed to you and decide what they'd like to do with them. Maybe they'll copy a letter and also put it into their mailbox, or maybe they'll delete it from your mailbox. 

The main benifit with fetching is that all of your filters and configuration are in once place. Fetching will only occur periodically, but with modern inboxes this isn't really a concenrn anymore.
