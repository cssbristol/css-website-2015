Too many inboxes? Did becomming a HPT screw you over now that you have to check both your `@bristol.ac.uk` and `@my.bristol.ac.uk` email? Well if that's the case this tutorial is for you!

## Email forwarding

Emails are really old[¹](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_email). The good part is that is you'd like to do something, someone else has probably thought about it and done it before you. 

There's two main ways to perform email forwarding: server based or client based[²](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Email_forwarding). Both ideas has its benifits and drawbacks which I'll hopefully give a brief overview of here. For my examples I'm going to assume that you use a Gmail inbox (the `@my.bristol.ac.uk` email) and would like to forward emails from Outlook (the `@bristol.ac.uk` email). The steps are very similar for forwarding between Gmail to Gmail, Gmail to Outlook and vice versa.
