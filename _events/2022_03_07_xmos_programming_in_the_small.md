Desktop computer systems have become much faster in half a century, with execution speeds that are 1,000x higher. At the
same time, memory size increased by 100,000x or so. Although desktop computers are, with mobile phones and tablets the
most visible computer systems, they are outnumbered by the number of embedded computers. Embedded computers are found in
for example TVs, soundbars, headphones, thermostats, and cars (the latter containing 10-50 embedded computers).

As there are so many embedded computers, they have to be much lower power and cheaper than desktops. To be cheap
desktops have to have little memory: 1-512 kByte of memory; every kByte costs a bit. To be low power embedded computers
should execute few instructions: they may be able to run at 800 MHz, but it is vastly more efficient to run them at 80
or 8 MHz.

In this talk Henk will discuss what it means to program systems with limited resources.
