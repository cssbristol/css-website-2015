## Join us for a staff & student board game session!

It will be a drop-in session – there’ll be lots of short games that are easy to pick up, even if you don’t play lots of board games, so pop by and meet some new people!

There’ll be a big pile of games, but if you’d like to bring your own, please do – shoot Sarah Connolly an email or msg her on teams if you’d like to check what games are being brought.

There will be some snacks, but bring your own too ;P
