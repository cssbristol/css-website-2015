Creditcall CTO Jeremy Gumbley (@Jeremy_Gumbley) is a technology entrepreneur and fintech veteran with 20+ years of payment and security experience.
As a tech innovator, he not only helped Creditcall become one of the first payment gateways in Europe but also facilitated the company’s PCI DSS Level 1 compliance, one of the very first payment gateways to achieve that level. Recognizing the significant impact EMV would have in the future, he directed the development of Creditcall’s EMV Kernel Portfolio. In 2014, he was pivotal in making Creditcall the first EMV-ready payment gateway to the US.
