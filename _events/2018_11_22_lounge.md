Confounded with currying? Confused by cryptography? In a crisis with classes? Cursed by contradiction? Cussing out calloc?

Come to CodeLounge, our communal coursework help and mentoring session. We encourage all freshers to come (undergraduate and masters!) - but everyone is welcome.

And if that isn't enough - there'll be free food.
