### Introducing: CSS Touch Grass series! ðŸŒ¿

Join us this Sunday for our first touch grass collab hosted by the Taekwondo society!

Get some exercise and learn some new martial arts moves taught by an international taekwondo athlete. No martial arts experience or special equipment needed, just bring along a water bottle, some comfortable clothing and a few friends if you have any.

Secure your tickets on the [event page](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/groups/computer-science-society-22c3/events/touch-grass-collabs-taekwondo). Be fast though, there are only 30 tickets available in total!
