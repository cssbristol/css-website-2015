### An exclusive on-campus event with alumni from Morgan Stanley, including a Senior Recruiter and 3 Associates.

You'll get an overview of the firm, followed by a panel Q&A covering advice and the tech division.

Finally, you'll be able to network with the panellists and ask further questions.

Students who attend will also have their applications for the Spring Week, Summer Internship and Grad Schemes flagged by a recruiter.

All students are welcome to come, but must fill in a [sign-up form](https://forms.gle/bxkE62DeAeXDRGaXA).
