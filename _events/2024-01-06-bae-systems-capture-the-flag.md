### BAE Systems are running a Capture the Flag event, a day of cyber security challenges and games.

Anybody who is currently enrolled at the University of Bristol can sign up and play. There are prizes for the winning team and goodies for anyone taking part!

Lunch and snacks will be provided by us. We’ll be around all day to provide hints and tips on the challenges and are happy to discuss careers in cyber security and software engineering in BAE Systems Digital Intelligence.

This is a team-based challenge for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – come along anyway as teams will be created on the day. The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic searches, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work, however a basic understanding of programming is recommended.

#### To sign up, please email [ctf@baesystems.com](ctf@baesystems.com) from your university email account with the following information:

- Your full name
- Your team name (if applicable)
- Your year of study
- Your course title

If you are signing up on behalf of others, please include the above information for them too. **The deadline for signing up is Tuesday 30th January**. We will email you to confirm your place and provide more details on the event and what you need to bring. We really hope to see you there!
