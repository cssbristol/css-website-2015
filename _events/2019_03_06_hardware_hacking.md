In this talk/discussion we will go over what hardware hacking is all about. We'll discuss what tools and resources are available to us to have a go at hardware hacking for ourselves. Finally, we'll go through a few examples of hardware "Hacks" and how they work.
This talk won't be about finding security exploits in computer hardware, It will be more focused creative rather than destructive goals.
