The theme of the puzzle hunt is Race to New York/London, where the puzzlers will start with 3 unlocked puzzles to solve.

Each solved puzzle will unlock a new one. There is a total number of 8 puzzles and one meta puzzle which uses the answers from the other 8 puzzles. The first team to solve the meta puzzle is the winning team.
