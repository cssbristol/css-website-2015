How do you deliver a secure Mobile Banking Experience? Our sponsor, Deloitte, are experienced consultants to the banking industry and, in this talk, they'll reveal some of the tricks of the trade.

The talk will focus on applying Security Engineering when delivering Mobile Banking Platforms - the critical activities, some of the technical issues and the importance of "secure by design". As part of the talk, Trevor and Kiril will also discuss some of the other aspects of security in the financial sector, e.g. offensive security under schemes such as CBEST.
