Come along to 1.11 in MVB for 24 hours of gaming with both COGS and the Computer Science Society! Everyone is encouraged to bring along their own setups, consoles and controllers. Entry is free for members or £5 for non-members (membership's only £3!). There'll be a pre-LAN meal beforehand on the Saturday as well and free Red Bull will be on offer throughout the LAN.
