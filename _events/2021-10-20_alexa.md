Alexa is Amazonâ€™s voice AI.

Alexa lives in the cloud and is happy to help anywhere there's internet access and a device that can connect to Alexa. Alexa Skills are like apps for Alexa, and provide a new channel for your content and services. In this workshop you will get hands-on experience using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), learn to design an engaging voice user interface (VUI), and build an Alexa skill from scratch.

Join us to learn how to build compelling voice experiences for Alexa.

Pre Requisites:

Computer with internet connection
Account on developer.amazon.com (its free to create)
