Have you ever felt underrepresented within the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) subject you are studying or want to study? Do you feel that currently, there is very little motivation to address the lack of diversity within STEM subjects?
We would like you to join us in talking about diversity in STEM and help us to identify positive ways to bring about change.
This ‘Diversity in STEM’ event will begin with a panel discussion focussed on overcoming barriers to progression and increasing awareness of career opportunities within STEM. Our panel will share their experiences of life as professional within the STEM sector. They belong to traditionally underrepresented groups such as: female (female aligned), BAME (British Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic) or LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender plus).
Following the discussion, an opportunity for networking with speakers as well as local and national companies who hire STEM graduates.
Fusion Society is collaborating with societies and departments across the university to bring you our third and final event. This event is open to all. Follow the link to secure a FREE ticket.
