Confused about coding? Crying over your compiler errors? Can't cope with computer conundrums? Confounded by category theory? Clashing with C?

CodeLounge is our communal coursework help and mentoring session. We encourage all freshers to come (undergraduate and masters!) - but everyone is welcome.
Join us, eat some food and find the fun side of programming #FreeFood
