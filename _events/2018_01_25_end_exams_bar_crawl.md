"Let's start our coursework!" Or "Spoons?"

Circle the correct answer, no justification needed. [ 2 marks ]

The route is:
- White Harte
- Berkeley
- Lolas

We'll be selling wristbands over the exam period and the week after in MVB!

Come as your favourite sorting algorithm or in your CSS Tshirt. We have some more from the last bar crawl left over so let us know if you'd like one!
