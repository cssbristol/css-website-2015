Need a calm break from the chaos that is CS? Come spend an afternoon mining iron ore and mass farming virtual chickens with CSS as we run a local Minecraft server!
Whether you prefer to hit people with fishing rods, or build elaborate mud huts, this event is to help clear your mind of university stress and disappear into a happy world for an afternoon
Bring along a laptop to join in, snacks will be provided
