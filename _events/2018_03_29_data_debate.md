Join us on Tuesday for the third & the last #DigitalDilemma event! A debate between Professor Nello Cristianini and Dr Carl Henrik Ek (CSS) will cover the perks and perils of our obsession with Data.
The combination of machine learning and big data has enabled us to create a new generation of Artificial Intelligence, and now we interact with its applications daily. This means that the AI agents are in the position to observe a large portion of our activities, but also creates a new type of risk – e.g. surveillance and manipulation of user behaviour.
Freaked out by the reports on psychometric election targeting and predictive analysis in criminal justice?
This debate might be a perfect opportunity to listen to our speakers debunking – or confirming – these fears.
