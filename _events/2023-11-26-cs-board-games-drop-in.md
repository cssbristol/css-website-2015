Drop in and play board games with CS students and staff.

We have lots of games that are easy to learn and join in.

If youâ€™re on Coursework weeks, take a brake and think of something different for an hour or two!

### (We'll be in the the lower atrium from 15:00-16:00, then in 1.11/a from 16:00)
