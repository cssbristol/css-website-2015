Mike Wray will be leading a workshop using PyTorch to train models. More in depth than the last one.

Feel free to look through the content from the previous workshop if you want a catch-up: [https://fsai.cssbristol.co.uk/post/machine-learning-tutorial](https://fsai.cssbristol.co.uk/post/machine-learning-tutorial).
