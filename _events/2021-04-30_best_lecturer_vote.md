Congrats on making it through the first week back after Easter! Hope you havenâ€™t forgotten to give your favourite lecturer a vote in the middle of that coursework and exam revision frenzy!

If you have forgotten, no worries! Thereâ€™s still time to vote!

Quick reminder on the categories:
- Oscar for Best Online Teaching
- Funniest Lecturer
- Most Creative Lecturer
- Most Enthusiastic
- Innovative Teaching
- Funniest Teams Background


Voting Information:
There are two voting forms:
- Best year lecturer (separate categories for each year)
- Other categories
You will only be able to make 1 submission per voting form.

You donâ€™t have to vote in every single category, but you wonâ€™t get another form submission if you change your mind later!

Voting ends on the 30th April, 23:45.

And remember, you can also optionally submit a video link or screenshot of that lecturer which may or may not be included in our super secret project for you guys ðŸ‘€


Award Ceremony:

The award ceremony will be held on **Wednesday 5th May 14:30-15:00**.

A separate event will be made for with the join info!

Event attendees will be entered into a random raffle to win a **Â£10 Just Eat** voucher as well!
