The department has recently established two External Advisory Boards (EAB) for Computer Science and Data Science. These are full of staff from industry/government/more who will help the department consider their teaching, research, and engagement with applied CS/Data Science.

CSS is working with the department to invite 2nd/3rd/4th to meet with members of the board. This is a great opportunity for students to ask questions about future careers, network, and give board members an idea of what it's like to study here.

There are two sessions on Thursday 07/03/19 - you can attend both if you want to:

* Data Science Industry Q&A -  1-2pm:

* Computer Science Q&A - 3-4pm:

Board members include Directors, CEOs and more from Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, Ultrahaptics, and more.
