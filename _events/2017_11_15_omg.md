Bored of coursework? Not had your weekly dose of cheesy pop music? Join CSS in our Explore Week trip to OMG! Bristolâ€™s number one glittery venue, itâ€™s guaranteed to be a night of cheap jager, banger tunes and questionable-quality drag ðŸ’ƒ
Pre with your CS families, then join us at The Berkeley before we stagger/crawl to OMG around midnight. Never been to OMG before? Donâ€™t miss this event with free entry, loads of Â£1 drinks and Bristolâ€™s number 1 drag queen Tina Sparkle âœ¨ Glitter is highly encouraged âœ¨

// Important note //
OMG is primarily an LGBT+ venue that encourages a welcoming and friendly environment for those who may feel discomfort or face discrimination in other venues. As such we ask that you be respectful of anyone expressing themselves in any way in OMG, and be mindful of language or behaviour that may be interpreted as offensive in this context. Everyone in OMG is there for a great time, and we hope you really enjoy the night too!
