Join us at our 4th Workshop this Thursday 10thOct, 17:00-19:00 in MVB 1.08.

This session is open to anyone. There are **no prerequisites**, It's **free** to join, and you don't need to have attended the workshop before.

**Workshop 4**: The aim of this workshop is for everyone to continue with the ROS basics. Hopefully now everyone is setup with our docker container and is familiar with some basic ROS concepts. For those new to the group, we can cover anything you have missed.

Bring your laptops if you want to use ROS!

If you haven't already, please join the Bristol FSAI team first:Â [https://forms.office.com/e/D3YhjrP9N1](https://forms.office.com/e/D3YhjrP9N1)


**What is the purpose of these workshops?:** We want to build a community of people passionate about machine learning, robotics, and autonomous driving. These workshops are a place for people to come and learn the core skills required to design and program an Autonomous Driving System (ADS). This will be fulfilled by sharing guides and resources for learning these skills through independent learning. The end goal is to have members design a basic ADS based on an existing system, eventually, building a more advanced system.
