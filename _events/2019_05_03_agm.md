CSS' AGM is upon us once again! Join us in <b>MVB 1.11(A) at 17:00, Friday 3rd May</b> to vote on motions and committee nominees.

If you're abroad this year or can't attend the AGM - don't worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.

(Nominations for First-Year Rep and Post-Grad Rep will be occur after the start of the next university year)

## Roles

<a class="btn btn--dark" href="http://bit.ly/css-agm19-roles">
    Nominate yourself for a role!
</a>

Could you see yourself at the helm of our next Hackathon or Bar Crawl? Being a committee member is a great way to gain experience running events, dealing with industrial sponsors and communications. And to boot - it's a whole lot of fun!

You will have a chance to speak for 60s (once, regardless of how many positions you apply for) during the AGM.

Here's a taste of what each role does:

{% for role in site.data.roles18-19 %}
### {{ role.role }}
<ul>
    {% for point in role.desc %}
        <li>{{ point }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endfor %}

Want to make a change to how the society runs? Put forward a motion to change our constitution (https://cssbristol.co.uk/constitution).

Constitutional changes must receive a two-thirds majority. Non-constitutional motions must receive a majority.
