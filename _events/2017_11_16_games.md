CSS and COGS meet again for another epic evening of pizza-fuelled gaming. COGS brings the games, and CSS brings the pizza!

With no lectures in Explore Week and free food and drinks throughout the evening, there is no excuse not to come!

In this event, we will be playing Smash, Mario Kart Rocket League, and much more! we will be providing controllers, but feel free to bring your own if you want to.
