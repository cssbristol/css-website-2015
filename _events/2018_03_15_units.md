You asked for it, you waited for it for a long time
Now, We are pleased to announce that for the first time we're organising a Units Choice Event
For a long time, students could not get a real feedback from each other and understand which unit they definitely would like to do and which is not their kind .
Now, you have this opportunity to get a real feedback from your peers and friends, or even more excitingly, you can share your own one!
If you want to hear a feedback about specific unit(s), you are welcome to tell us about them using this form:
https://goo.gl/forms/tvzppaqyISJZw3kU2
Besides, If you think your opinion and experience (good/neutral/bad) must be shared with other students about particular unit(s) and you would like do so, tell us about it using the same form, as above.
Free pizza will be provided!
