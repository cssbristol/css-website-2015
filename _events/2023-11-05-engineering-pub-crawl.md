This is in collaboration with all the engineering societies and means we can finally leave our rooms 😍 
In order to prove you're one of us make sure you're wearing green clothes/makeup/body paint!

We're dropping first into the W.G Grace at 7:30 and proceeding all the way to Lola Lo's for some discounted drinks and entry.
Excited to see everyone there!!🔥🔥
