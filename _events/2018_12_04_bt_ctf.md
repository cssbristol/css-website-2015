BT Security are running a Capture the Flag (CTF) event on Tuesday 4th December 2018. This challenge will test your knowledge of ciphers, encryption, reverse-engineering, web exploits and much more. All levels of ability and experience are welcome as there will be tricky challenges to engage beginners and experts alike. You may find it helpful to use the internet to solve these challenges.

This event is being held in MVB 1.11 and registration will start at 6:00pm, with the event starting promptly at 6:30pm. It will run for approximately 2 hours, with a pizza break in the middle!

This event will be run by 3 Bristol alumni who are currently on the graduate scheme. There will be plenty of opportunities to speak to us about our exciting summer student and graduate programmes.

This challenge should be completed in teams of sizes 2-3. If you don‚Äôt have a team yet then no need to worry, we will easily be able to slot you into a team on the day.

You will all need to bring a laptop so that you can connect to the CTF webpage.

Looking forward to seeing you all!
