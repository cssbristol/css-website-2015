Staying in Bristol over Reading Week?

Come and play some boardgames at this drop-in session for students and staff!

The games will be short and simple, so you can come along at any time in the session and join in.

If you want to bring your own games, please do - you can ping Sarah Connolly at [sarah.connolly@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sarah.connolly@bristol.ac.uk) to check if she's already bringing something.
