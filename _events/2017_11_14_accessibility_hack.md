In six hours, it's up to you to build something that makes the world a more accessible place.

What will you build? Here are some ideas to get you started.
* Screen readers for augmented reality
* An alternative to mouse and keyboard
* Eye-tracking interfaces
* Hearing aids that only relay the most important information
* A design for privacy settings that children can understand
There will be food, drinks and prizes (of course!)
