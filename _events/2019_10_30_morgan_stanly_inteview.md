Morgan Stanley believes capital has the power to create positive change. We help the world finance great ideas that move society forward, and we rely on technology to do it.

If you’re passionate about solving problems, working as part of a team, and being exposed to a huge variety of cutting-edge technologies, join us.

We’re running an interactive two-hour technical interview and assessment centre skills session to help you prepare for your application to Technology at Morgan Stanley. You’ll have the chance to work through practice questions and coding exercises, as well as a mock group exercise, with our technologists. We hope the session will give you an opportunity to prepare for upcoming interviews and an insight into Technology careers with us.
