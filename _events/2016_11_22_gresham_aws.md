Gresham Computing are coming to the department to talk about AWS and cloud computing.

We will give a brief overview of considerations and potential pitfalls when starting out building a service on a cloud computing platform. In addition to building the core functionality we will explore topics including build pipelines, continuous delivery, monitoring, high availability and disaster recovery.

Discussed technologies:

* Build & Deployment - AWS CloudFormation, Spot Fleets, Docker & Chef
* Monitoring - Amazon CloudWatch, Nagios, Splunk
* Microservices - AWS Lambda
* Relational and Document Stores - AWS Aurora and DynamoDB
