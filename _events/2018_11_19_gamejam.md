# Theme:
It's a secret!

# Rules (tl;dr-edition):
* Teams of up to 6 people
    -> Teams made of 50% or more committee **cannot** win
* Use whatever engine you like
    -> Judging will take the complexity into account, however

# Q&A:
- I don't have a team!
    - That's OK! We'll team you up with some other people :)
- I don't feel skilled enough to participate!
    - You probably are! A lot of time spent in hackathons is spent on learning - first years have won in the past
- I don't have a good game idea!
    - Have a look at some other games for inspiration; copy an existing game; or use this idea generator: http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen
- Will there be free pizza?
    - You know it.

Make sure to go to the Games Industry Panel event too (1 hour before the start)!
