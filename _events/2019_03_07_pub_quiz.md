Join us at Racks Bar & Kitchen for a Pub Quiz like no other!

Make sure you bring a laptop and get ready to exercise your problem solving skills in a series of fun coding challenges!

FREE FOOD & DRINK

PRIZES for the winning teams (Raspberry Pis and a Hotel Chocolat Hamper)

We recommend teams of about 5-6 people, but smaller groups are welcome too, and if you’re unsure who to come with then we’ll be happy to match you up with other keen problem solvers on the day.
