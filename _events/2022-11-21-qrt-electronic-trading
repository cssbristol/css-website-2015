QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors. Join us for this talk where we will offer a window into the world of electronic trading and life at the fastest growing and best performing quant hedge fund over the last few years. One of our senior engineers, Dominic Browne will walk through the stack that makes up a trading system and cover some of the intricacies of the exciting technical challenges we work on. You will hear from Xander Sheppard who joined QRT as a graduate 2 years ago on what it’s like to be a part of QRT as a technologist and the quant finance space in general, along with why our culture is pivotal to our success. Followed by some insights into our opportunities, our interview process and how you can apply.

Plus you will get your hands on a bunch of free epic QRT merch too. Our journey has just begun so don’t miss this!
