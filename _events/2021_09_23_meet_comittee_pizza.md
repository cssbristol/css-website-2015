**Freshers Event**

Come and say hi to the committee at the CSS stand at the department’s pop-up event. You can learn more about what we do, how you can get involved, and receive some freebies too!

There’ll be free pizza (which, weather permitting, we'll go to the Royal Fort Gardens to enjoy) before we head over to The Brass Pig at 19:00 for welcome drinks!
