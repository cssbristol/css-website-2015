This fast paced talk is aimed at everyone - no background in machine learning is assumed, just familiarity with web technologies like JavaScript is preferred to get the most out of the example code which may even give you ideas for your final year thesis or future research. Everyone will be able to appreciate the concepts and demos regardless of your background so do come join this very special one off talk if you have a curiosity about machine learning - which has the potential to influence every industry out there. There will also be Q&amp;amp;A time at the end in case you have any questions about life at Google, (Jason has worked there for 11 years now), or anything you saw in the talk.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

Space weather describes conditions in space that can interact with the Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere and magnetic field and disrupt our infrastructure and technology including power grids, radio communications and satellite operations including GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Office owns the UK space weather risk on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and as part of the National Risk Assessment mitigation strategy, delivers space weather services to government, critical national infrastructure (CNI) providers, international partners such as ESA, PECASUS, KNMI and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CACI Information Intelligence Group were asked to undertake this project to enhance the existing Met Office space weather forecast systems and the services it delivers to customers. These enhancements include implementing new scientific forecasting models, incorporating new data sources and a full migration of the system into the AWS cloud while maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Weather is on the UK‚Äôs national risk registry as a high impact, high likelihood event and as such this system needs to be secure and have 24/7/365 high availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-speakers&quot;&gt;About the speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Paget - Chris has spent the last 6 years working in software, in industries such as engineering through to consulting, going from grad to tech lead. He‚Äôs spent most of his time working with Java Spring-boot apps, although still has a soft-spot for VBA. In his spare time Chris enjoys a variety of racquet sports and surfing (whenever the weather allows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence Webb - Laurence has worked for CACI for over 4 years as a software developer and currently is a technical lead for the Space Weather project. During his software engineering career, he‚Äôs had the chance to work on a variety of technologies both front-end and back-end. His current favourites are AWS, infrastructure as code &amp;amp; Docker. Outside of work, he enjoys getting outdoors - mostly for climbing &amp;amp; skiing&lt;/p&gt;
