&lt;p&gt;Are you a STEM student looking for an opportunity to express your creative and artistic side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to invite you to take part in ART-HACK 23
This hackathon is designed for all students from across the faculty, who are interested in experimenting with technology to express yourself. (No art experience needed!) Whether you’re interested in programming, electronics, VR, robotics, or a combination of these. This event will be an opportunity to come together in a small team (or solo), to explore the potential of your technical skills in creative digital and immersive art context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes of the event are “Dreams and Sleep” or “Beauty of order and randomness”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead up to the event, we will be hosting a range of skills workshops to introduce you to the equipment available for the event, this is likely to include, soldering, Arduino and CAD&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Competition&quot;]" /><summary type="html">SIGN UP HERE</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Art Hack Intro to Programming Embedded Systems</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Art Hack Intro to Programming Embedded Systems" /><published>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-embed-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are doing electronics as part of your Art Hack 2023 project then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are doing electronics as part of your Art Hack 2023 project then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Art Hack Electronics Workshop</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Art Hack Electronics Workshop" /><published>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-elec-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are doing electronics as part of your Art Hack 2023 project then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are doing electronics as part of your Art Hack 2023 project then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Web ML With TensorFlow.js</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-03-03-tf-js/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Web ML With TensorFlow.js" /><published>2023-02-03T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-03T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/tf-js</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-03-03-tf-js/">&lt;p&gt;Jason will demonstrate through live demos and just a few lines of code how you can within minutes, recognize objects, predict the pose of your body, sound recognition and much more.

Space weather describes conditions in space that can interact with the Earth’s upper atmosphere and magnetic field and disrupt our infrastructure and technology including power grids, radio communications and satellite operations including GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Office owns the UK space weather risk on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and as part of the National Risk Assessment mitigation strategy, delivers space weather services to government, critical national infrastructure (CNI) providers, international partners such as ESA, PECASUS, KNMI and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CACI Information Intelligence Group were asked to undertake this project to enhance the existing Met Office space weather forecast systems and the services it delivers to customers. These enhancements include implementing new scientific forecasting models, incorporating new data sources and a full migration of the system into the AWS cloud while maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Weather is on the UK’s national risk registry as a high impact, high likelihood event and as such this system needs to be secure and have 24/7/365 high availability.&lt;/p&gt;
