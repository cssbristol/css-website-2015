&lt;p&gt;Are you a STEM student looking for an opportunity to express your creative and artistic side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to invite you to take part in ART-HACK 23
This hackathon is designed for all students from across the faculty, who are interested in experimenting with technology to express yourself. (No art experience needed!) Whether you’re interested in programming, electronics, VR, robotics, or a combination of these. This event will be an opportunity to come together in a small team (or solo), to explore the potential of your technical skills in creative digital and immersive art context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes of the event are “Dreams and Sleep” or “Beauty of order and randomness”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead up to the event, we will be hosting a range of skills workshops to introduce you to the equipment available for the event, this is likely to include, soldering, Arduino and CAD&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Competition&quot;]" /><summary type="html">SIGN UP HERE</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intro to Programming Embedded Systems</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intro to Programming Embedded Systems" /><published>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-embed-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are interesting in working with embedded technology for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are interesting in working with embedded technology for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Electronics Workshop</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Electronics Workshop" /><published>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-elec-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are doing electronics for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are doing electronics for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Post Exam Drinks</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-08-post-exam-drinks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Post Exam Drinks" /><published>2023-02-08T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-08T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/post-exam-drinks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-08-post-exam-drinks/">&lt;p&gt;Now that exams are over why don’t you treat yourself to a break?

This fast paced talk is aimed at everyone - no background in machine learning is assumed, just familiarity with web technologies like JavaScript is preferred to get the most out of the example code which may even give you ideas for your final year thesis or future research. Everyone will be able to appreciate the concepts and demos regardless of your background so do come join this very special one off talk if you have a curiosity about machine learning - which has the potential to influence every industry out there. There will also be Q&amp;amp;A time at the end in case you have any questions about life at Google, (Jason has worked there for 11 years now), or anything you saw in the talk.”&lt;/p&gt;

Space weather describes conditions in space that can interact with the Earth’s upper atmosphere and magnetic field and disrupt our infrastructure and technology including power grids, radio communications and satellite operations including GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Office owns the UK space weather risk on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and as part of the National Risk Assessment mitigation strategy, delivers space weather services to government, critical national infrastructure (CNI) providers, international partners such as ESA, PECASUS, KNMI and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CACI Information Intelligence Group were asked to undertake this project to enhance the existing Met Office space weather forecast systems and the services it delivers to customers. These enhancements include implementing new scientific forecasting models, incorporating new data sources and a full migration of the system into the AWS cloud while maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Weather is on the UK’s national risk registry as a high impact, high likelihood event and as such this system needs to be secure and have 24/7/365 high availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-speakers&quot;&gt;About the speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Paget - Chris has spent the last 6 years working in software, in industries such as engineering through to consulting, going from grad to tech lead. He’s spent most of his time working with Java Spring-boot apps, although still has a soft-spot for VBA. In his spare time Chris enjoys a variety of racquet sports and surfing (whenever the weather allows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence Webb - Laurence has worked for CACI for over 4 years as a software developer and currently is a technical lead for the Space Weather project.
