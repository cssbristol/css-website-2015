&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own unique image of what a perfect utopia looks like, so dream up a project that will help us get to what your (or your team’s) image of what a Utopian Society looks like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky is the limit with what you can do—we want to see the full breadth of your imagination, from projects tackling economic equality, sustainability issues, social welfare or even creativity and artistic expression; show us how you would want to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-inexperienced-as-a-programmer-can-i-still-participate&quot;&gt;I’m inexperienced as a programmer, can I still participate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course! Participating in a Hackathon is a great way to get more experience; you can either join a team of more experienced participants and learn from them, or participate yourself and grow from the challenge, and hopefully even gain an awesome portfolio piece by the end of the Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, it isn’t all about winning; BrisHack is a fun event for you to learn and explore new technologies and areas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-find-a-team&quot;&gt;How do I find a team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be hosting a team-finding event (a social mingle) the week before the Hackathon; watch this space for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, post on our discord servers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-dont-attend-the-university-of-bristol-can-i-participate&quot;&gt;I don’t attend the University of Bristol, can I participate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you are a student aged over eighteen at a university or college in the UK, you are welcome to join!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-food-be-provided&quot;&gt;Will food be provided?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re offended you even asked; we always have food! Just make sure to let us know if you have any dietary requirements!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-dont-study-a-stem-discipline-can-i-participate&quot;&gt;I don’t study a STEM discipline, can I participate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrisHack is open to all! If you have even basic technological knowledge, we’d love to see what you make. Alternatively, if you lack technological powress but have an awesome idea, perhaps you can join a team and be their ideas-person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-i-need-to-dream-up-a-solution-to-a-hugevery-serious-problem&quot;&gt;Do I need to dream up a solution to a huge/very serious problem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to solve a huge problem; progress comes in small nudges! If you think you’ve got the cure to world hunger, that’s awesome! But don’t be put off entering because you are tackling a small issue; oftentimes it’s the focussed solutions that are the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-brishack&quot;&gt;About BrisHack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrisHack is the annual 24-hour Hackathon run by the University of Bristol’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssbristol.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Computer Science Society (CSS)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beees.co.uk&quot;&gt;Electrical and Electronic Engineering Society (BEEES)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Are you a STEM student looking for an opportunity to express your creative and artistic side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to invite you to take part in ART-HACK 23
This hackathon is designed for all students from across the faculty, who are interested in experimenting with technology to express yourself. (No art experience needed!) Whether you’re interested in programming, electronics, VR, robotics, or a combination of these. This event will be an opportunity to come together in a small team (or solo), to explore the potential of your technical skills in creative digital and immersive art context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes of the event are “Dreams and Sleep” or “Beauty of order and randomness”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead up to the event, we will be hosting a range of skills workshops to introduce you to the equipment available for the event, this is likely to include, soldering, Arduino and CAD&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Competition&quot;]" /><summary type="html">SIGN UP HERE</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intro to Programming Embedded Systems</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intro to Programming Embedded Systems" /><published>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-17T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-embed-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-17-art-hack-embed-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are interesting in working with embedded technology for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are interesting in working with embedded technology for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Electronics Workshop</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Electronics Workshop" /><published>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/art-hack-elec-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-13-art-hack-elec-workshop/">&lt;p&gt;If you are doing electronics for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Workshop&quot;]" /><summary type="html">If you are doing electronics for a project, ArtHack, or BrisHack then come along and get a refresher in a quick workshop!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Post Exam Drinks</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-08-post-exam-drinks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Post Exam Drinks" /><published>2023-02-08T19:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-08T19:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/post-exam-drinks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2023-02-08-post-exam-drinks/">&lt;p&gt;Now that exams are over why don’t you treat yourself to a break?

Space weather describes conditions in space that can interact with the Earth’s upper atmosphere and magnetic field and disrupt our infrastructure and technology including power grids, radio communications and satellite operations including GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Office owns the UK space weather risk on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and as part of the National Risk Assessment mitigation strategy, delivers space weather services to government, critical national infrastructure (CNI) providers, international partners such as ESA, PECASUS, KNMI and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CACI Information Intelligence Group were asked to undertake this project to enhance the existing Met Office space weather forecast systems and the services it delivers to customers. These enhancements include implementing new scientific forecasting models, incorporating new data sources and a full migration of the system into the AWS cloud while maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Weather is on the UK’s national risk registry as a high impact, high likelihood event and as such this system needs to be secure and have 24/7/365 high availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-speakers&quot;&gt;About the speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Paget - Chris has spent the last 6 years working in software, in industries such as engineering through to consulting, going from grad to tech lead. He’s spent most of his time working with Java Spring-boot apps, although still has a soft-spot for VBA. In his spare time Chris enjoys a variety of racquet sports and surfing (whenever the weather allows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence Webb - Laurence has worked for CACI for over 4 years as a software developer and currently is a technical lead for the Space Weather project. During his software engineering career, he’s had the chance to work on a variety of technologies both front-end and back-end. His current favourites are AWS, infrastructure as code &amp;amp; Docker. Outside of work, he enjoys getting outdoors - mostly for climbing &amp;amp; skiing&lt;/p&gt;
