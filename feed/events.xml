&lt;p&gt;BAE Systems are running a Capture the Flag event, a day of cyber security challenges and games, on Saturday 29th October. Anybody who is currently enrolled at The University of Bristol can sign up and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a team-based challenge for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – come along anyway as teams will be created on the day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic searches, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;Competition&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Sign Up Form: https://forms.office.com/r/zRDHQxeGHt</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSS EGM 2022</title><link href="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2022-10-19-egm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSS EGM 2022" /><published>2022-10-19T17:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-10-19T17:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/egm</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2022-10-19-egm/">&lt;p&gt;Do you love pizza?

This was the starting point for Bristol’s microelectronics industry, leading to the development of the Inmos Transputer, the first microcomputer designed for parallel computing. It was used by thousands of researchers and students around the world. It was used both in high-performance computers and consumer products; over 1 billion products incorporating the Inmos technology were shipped. The many highly skilled technologists who joined Inmos went on to form new companies and enabled the region to attract investment from global technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

Join Jason Mayes, Senior Developer Relations Engineer at Google, as he walks you through what machine learning is,  along with how you can use it to level up web apps for your next creative idea (or even startup), to get super powers by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason will demonstrate through live demos and just a few lines of code how you can within minutes, recognize objects, predict the pose of your body, sound recognition and much more. This fast paced talk is aimed at everyone - no background in machine learning is assumed, just familiarity with web technologies like JavaScript is preferred to get the most out of the example code which may even give you ideas for your final year thesis or future research. Everyone will be able to appreciate the concepts and demos regardless of your background so do come join this very special one off talk if you have a curiosity about machine learning - which has the potential to influence every industry out there. There will also be Q&amp;amp;A time at the end in case you have any questions about life at Google, (Jason has worked there for 11 years now), or anything you saw in the talk.”&lt;/p&gt;
