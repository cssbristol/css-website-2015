## Application deadline
**QRT recruits interns on a rolling basis. Apply early to maximise your chances of success!**

## About QRT
Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious penultimate year STEM students or upcoming graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Data Development group for a 12-week summer internship.

## The Opportunity
The Software Development group is essential to QRT – our advanced technology platforms have been deployed to cover all geographies and asset classes globally. You will join a specific team aligned to your skills and interests, gaining unique insights into our cutting-edge trading systems across the full stack. Working closely with a range of people from across the business globally, including QRT’s Researchers & Traders, Technology teams and other groups within QRT, giving you an unparalleled opportunity to learn and drive meaningful change.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your time at QRT, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system and how system architecture designs are implemented – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience within the trading systems environment from front to back, hardware to software.

Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at QRT and the sorts of problems you would solve. Successfully completing our internship programme is a fast-track way of securing a return place at QRT as a full-time graduate software engineer.


## Team Responsibilities:
