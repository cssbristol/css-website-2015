## Job Description
We are [the electrical energy management](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/em/) group under the The Electrical Machine Works, and we are looking for a student or postgraduate (possibly several) to assist in the development of CAD tooling.

As part of our push toward Carbon Net Zero we are developing 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools to take advantage of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM, 3D printing) in the design of next generation electrical machines. We are seeking support in developing high quality extensible software tools. We anticipate using web technologies (React, React-Three-Fiber) on Desktop via Tauri with a Python based back-end using the OPENCASCADE geometry kernel.

Applicant(s) will ideally have experience of full stack development.
