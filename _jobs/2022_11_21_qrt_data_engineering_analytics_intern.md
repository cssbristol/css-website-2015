## About QRT
Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges.

You will join a specific team aligned to your skills and interests, gaining unique insights into our cutting-edge trading systems.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your time with QRT, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software and data engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience on building and scaling reliable data services with a focus on data quality and reliability.

Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at QRT and the sorts of problems you would solve. Successfully completing our internship programme is a fast-track way of securing a return place at QRT as a full-time graduate engineer.
