We are currently looking for an enthusiastic individual to work alongside TPP’s Commercial Team, assisting them with reviewing legal documents, checking for accuracy and identifying risks. The role involves careful examination of written documents and proposing alternative or additional drafting. You will also assist with bidding for new contracts, executing agreements and providing ongoing contract management, ensuring that TPP is delivering an excellent standard of service to its customers and that its suppliers are meeting their obligations. This will involve contracts at all levels – from agreements with individual organisations to high value national contracts.

You will also be required to assist with reviewing accompanying documentation, such as company policies and procedures, ensuring that the documents are suitably maintained and relevant. You will also attend meetings with stakeholders.

No previous legal or contractual experience is required and full on-the-job training will be provided. This role would suit someone with a keen eye for detail, great written communication and excellent organisational skills.
