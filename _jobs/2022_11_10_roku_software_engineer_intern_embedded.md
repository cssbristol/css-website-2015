## About the role  
With so many people using our products globally, we’ve become well-known for products that “just work” right out of the box and integrate almost by magic. That doesn’t happen by accident, which is why we are committed to making sure our products aren’t just intuitive, they’re obvious. Our goal is to help people find what they want and make it easier for people to stream across all our platforms. We accomplish this using state-of-the-art technology and engineering to make it happen, with consideration for the customer as the center of all that we do.

We are looking for engineering interns with embedded systems experience to join Roku across a variety of teams including Roku OS, Emerging Technologies, Roku TV, Audio, Platform Portability, and more. You will be responsible for core tasks ranging from partner SOC board bring-up, third-party API integration, Roku OS feature development, code maintenance, designing scalability solutions to help onboard new factories, supporting our QA and Channel certification teams, and everything else involved in our end-to-end product development and release cycles.

We are looking for students who can help us keep up this pace and continue delivering a high-quality streaming experience as we grow. We have roles on teams across the UK, including Cambridge, Manchester and Cardiff.


## This role is for you if you
- Are currently pursuing a Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science or a related field.
- Graduating in December 2023 or later.
- Understand Linux, tools, libraries and open-source development.
- Have foundational understanding of C/C++ coding skills (modern C++ exp. is a major plus!)
- Experience with developing/debugging on Linux based embedded platforms.


## The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
