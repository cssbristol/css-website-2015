**BAE Systems Digital Intelligence**<br>
**Cyber & Vulnerability Research Summer Internship**<br>
**Start date:** June 2023<br>
**Base location:** London or Gloucester

Here at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, we are committed to helping governments, organisations and society navigate digital threats and opportunities. Whether it’s leveraging data to digitally transform operations or securing organisations and nations from cyber threats, we combine our unrivalled security and engineering heritage to help our clients navigate the data-reliant digital landscape. 

As the cyber and intelligence arm of BAE Systems, we employ over 4,800 people across 15 countries in North America, APAC, Europe and the Middle East. With our distinguished heritage, we relish the opportunity to transform digital and data practices, defence, intelligence, security and society for government agencies, law enforcement, financial services, and critical infrastructure.

The Summer Internship programme aims to provide an environment that supports the acquisition of knowledge and experience from industry best practices and importantly, provide roles allowing the application of that understanding through practical experience in day-to-day roles.

You will be part of our Future Talent Community and be assigned a Career Manager, who will support and guide you throughout your career with us. All of this is designed to complement your career development, fuel your ambition, and give depth to your training and career. 

## Role Profile
You will work as a part of a project team, alongside skilled and experienced individuals who are motivated to train and coach you on the day-to-day skills required to work closely with our customers, both internal and external.

Engineering Interns will support their team to ensure that engineering practices are followed on all aspects of project definition and delivery.

- Working with varied technologies, using the latest and current versions

Due to the nature of our work, successful candidates for this role will be required to go through Government Security Clearance, prior to starting with us.

- Excellent analytical and numerical skills

- Articulate, both verbally and in writing
- Strong interpersonal skills
- Objective and logical with an enquiring and creative mind
- Ability to work as part of a team
