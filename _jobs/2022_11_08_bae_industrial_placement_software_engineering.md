**Software Engineering Industrial Placement (12 months)**

**Start date:** September 2023

**Base location:** Gloucester, Leeds, or London

Here at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, we exist to protect and enhance the connected world. We are committed to helping governments, organisations and society navigate digital threats and opportunities.

A core aspect of our work involves supporting our customers in undertaking large scale programmes of work, either as a large scale system development, system evolution, or acting as a prime integrator where we take capabilities from both within BAE Systems and our suppliers to create bespoke solutions to mission problems.

Undertaking this type of work relies on a range on engineering disciplines being brought together in a cohesive way, accounting for security, reliability, supportability, and value for the customer. We seek to develop and maintain the skillsets to ensure each of the options continue to be available to us, and to make the right solution choice for the situation. To achieve this, we are looking to recruit those with the potential to be great engineers.

As the cyber and intelligence arm of BAE Systems, we employ over 4,800 people around the world, with the main focus being here in the UK. This presents a prolific set of opportunities for our engineers to develop their skills and progress their careers.

The Internship programme is designed to give you ownership of your career aspirations, supported by training and practical experience to help you succeed.
