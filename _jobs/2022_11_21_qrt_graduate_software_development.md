## About QRT
Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) is a global quantitative and systematic investment manager, operating in all liquid asset classes across the world. We are a technology and data driven group implementing a scientific approach to investing. Combining data, research, technology and trading expertise has shaped QRT’s collaborative mindset which enables us to solve the most complex challenges. QRT’s culture of innovation continuously drives our ambition to deliver high quality returns for our investors.

We are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious penultimate year STEM students or upcoming graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Data Development group for a 12-week summer internship.

## The Opportunity
We are proud of our exceptionally talented, collaborative and diverse teams who are driving QRT’s innovation and growth, and are looking to add motivated, intellectually curious STEM graduates with entrepreneurial spirit to join our Software Development group. We strongly believe that long-term investment into our people is critical to our future success and distinctive culture, as demonstrated by our low staff turnover and continuous growth.

The Software Development group is fundamental to QRT – our advanced technology platforms have been deployed to cover all geographies and asset classes globally. As a graduate software engineer you will join and rotate through a number of different teams within our Technology function, gaining unique insights into our cutting-edge trading systems across the full stack. Working closely with a range of people from across the business globally, including QRT’s Researchers & Traders, Technology teams and other groups within QRT, giving you an unparalleled opportunity to learn and drive meaningful change.

You will be given continuous, hands-on training and mentorship from an experienced QRT colleague and the wider business throughout your career, helping you to learn technologies unique to the financial sector, soft skills and best practices within professional software engineering. We will demystify the world of systematic trading, explaining the core components of a global trading system and how system architecture designs are implemented – previous finance experience is not required! You will receive practical experience within the trading systems environment from front to back, hardware to software.


## Technologies and Projects
Based on your skills, interests and the groups project pipeline, you will be assigned real-world, impactful projects and given full ownership of them.

Projects across our Software Development group can span anything across our high performance, cross asset trading and research systems. Here are some examples:
- Developing our ultra-low latency trading system in C++, where we work down to nanosecond latencies and interact with low-level technologies like FPGA’s.
- Building out new large-scale data visualisation platforms and tools in Python using modern web tools and new data science concepts.
- Expanding and re-writing our GUI stack to incorporate new technologies.
- Building out strategic new parts of our platforms using C#/C++/Python and various other technologies like a new risk engine that computes huge volumes of data in real time, and everything else in between.
 
**Technologies you could work with include:** C/C++/C#/Python/React development, distributed systems, FPGA’s, Linux, Windows, AWS etc. as well as all of our internal software engineering tools.

We value motivated, curious engineers who can influence and change our development environments and controls, making improvement suggestions to the development team. You will be challenged to find ways to improve functionality and performance, and are invited and encouraged to teach us any new techniques you discover in the process!


## What are we looking for:
- A degree (Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD) in any STEM subject (computer science, physics, mathematics or any related engineering discipline) graduating and available to start on/before September 2023.
- Demonstrable passion for technology! Regardless of whether you have formal CompSci training or not – - we are more interested in your achievements related to software engineering. For example - hobbies, past-time, open source or academic projects, etc. covering the following:
  - Software Development, ideally with: C++, C# or Python.
  - Scripting languages e.g. Python or Bash.
  - Tools like GIT, SQL, gcc.
  - Linux platform.
- Pro-active and unafraid to ask questions. You can really have a huge impact here, improving our performance with suggestions and optimisations.
- Entrepreneurial approach and self-motivated.
