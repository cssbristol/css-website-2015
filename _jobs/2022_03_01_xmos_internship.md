Ideally you will have an appreciation of some of these topics:
- Programming microcontrollers.
- Contributing to open-source (including your own) projects.
- Scripting, such as Python.
- Continuous integration and deployment.
- Electronic circuit design.
- Digital signal processing.
- Machine learning or artificial intelligence.


## Previous projects have included:
### Technology Team
- CI/CD work for automation
- Visualisation tools for code analysis
- Dataset generation
- ML model training

### Applications team
