How do companies deliver software to their customers? Oracle has to do this at huge scale, delivering software at a wide variety of frequencies for a whole range of different needs.

Topic we'll cover include:

* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Integration
* Clojure
* Docker

How do you pick a process to build, test, and release software? A process that delivers frequent improvements whilst ensuring a reliable product? How can you assess whether the choice of steps and actions was sensible? If the choices were not sensible, how would you improve on them?

We offer some answers to these questions, arming you with an understanding and some techniques to assess and improve a software delivery process.
