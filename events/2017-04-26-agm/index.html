              The time of year has come! The time where the CSS Committee step
              down and pass the torch onto a new team to carry the future CSS
              banner into battle and lead the greatest society on Earth!

            </p>

            <p>
              The Annual CSS AGM is the event where we gather together as a
              society and discuss how the year has gone and vote on how we
              continue forward (as well as voting in a brand new committee!)
            </p>

            <h2 id="president">President</h2>

            <p>
              The head of the committee and the person mainly responsible for
              the committee. The President leads the society. The President also
              organises committee meetings, chairs all meetings and makes the
              agendas. The President is also generally responsible for
              delegating responsibilities and making sure people are on top of
              their jobs. Generally, if outsiders want to interact with the
              society, the President will be their first point of contact.

              <p>
                As a member of this years committee I believe that we have
                provided a great year of events and opportunities. I will
                continue the packed year we’ve had, as well as tailor events
                more to the student body by holding more larger hack-style
                events like the Hackathon and Google Hash Code. Tutorials and
                introduction type events would be held to ensure that all who
                want to take part have the confidence to do so. These events
                could be held in conjunction with other engineering department
                societies to create a wider community as well as expand
                everyone’s skill-sets.

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I also want to increase the role that the society plays in
                academic and pastoral care by providing dedicated pathways for
                members of the society to escalate issues to do with workload,
                quality of work and any other academic or pastoral issue. The
                society must be better equipped to deal with, and be more
                involved with the academic side of university life. This could
                potentially be in the form of collating revision notes for
                modules or arranging study groups.

              <p>
                I think Computer Scientists at Bristol form an amazing community
                of people and I want to make sure the community is given every
                opportunity to thrive. I want the society to be one where
                everyone feels like they can openly contribute and have an
                impact on what the society does. As President my key policies
                would be to introduce a spring formal, organise more regular
                socials, and provide members with more opportunities to take
                part in events that enrich their academic interests (Hackathons,
                Coding Challenges, etc.). If you’d like to know more about my
                policies, check out my manifesto.

              matters and is generally responsible for sponsorship (Getting
              sponsorships, getting contracts, being the point of contact for
              sponsors, etc.). The Vice-president can also act as a secondary
              chair for meetings (Or the primary chair if the President can’t
              make it but wants the meeting to go ahead).

                CSS is more important than ever to ensure that next year is the
                greatest year for the CSS so far. I’ve worked as a part of a

                the skills and experience needed for this role. I’ve also gained

              <p>
                The secretary position is essential for keeping CSS running
                smoothly, but is often kept behind the scenes. I want to
                encourage transparency by publishing minutes for all to see so
                society members know what’s going on and can actively support or
                oppose changes being made. I’m experienced with administration,
                having run a first aid course, an afterschool club, sales events
                for a Young Enterprise company and large group trips, all of
                which required extensive documentation. But most importantly,
                I’m here to ensure documents are filled in before you even know
                you need them!
              </p>

              <p>
                Above the role of secretary, I aim to be a proactive committee
                member who will work for your best interests. I’d like to foster
                a greater sense of community, ensuring everyone knows who the
                committee members are and where they can go to get the help they
                need, be it with running an event or applying to internships.
                And finally, whilst mental health is a buzzword around the
                University, I believe it is massively important to ensure the
                wellbeing of every individual in our department and that it is
                the duty of the society to do as such. CSS will be there for
                you, and will work together with the SSLC and the SU to give you
                a more balanced university life.

              This motion will add 2 CSS committee roles, both named ‘General’.
              These two roles will be full roles of the committee, have full
              voting rights (and will attend meetings) but will not have a
              specific responsibility. The ‘general’ role will be more of an
              assisting role to any other role that needs an extra pair of
              hands. For example, if the Treasurer needs to get forms filled and
              submitted to the bank but cannot do it, for some reason, or the
              Advertising officer needs posters put up but is away for a few
              days, the ‘General’ role can be asked to do either of these tasks.

              Motion 2017-02: Introduce a first year CSS Rep
            </h3>

            <p>
              Currently, first years don’t have anyone to represent them on the
              CSS committee due to all positions being elected in the AGM during
              the previous year.
            </p>

            <p>
              This motion proposes the CSS introduce a First Year CSS Rep to the
              committee. The position would be elected in an EGM in October or
              November. An interim rep would be elected at the AGM to hold the
              position until the EGM in October or November.
            </p>

            <p>
              A First Year CSS Rep would be responsible for providing first
              year’s with a voice in the committee. They would also play a major
              part in organising first year specific events and schemes (like
              parenting) for the following year.
            </p>

            <p>
              A First Year CSS Rep can only be nominated if they are currently
              studying their first year of Computer Science.
            </p>
